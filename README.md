# Knights Travails

- Assignment project for the JavaScript CS course at [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

- A knight/horsey can move to any square on the standard 8x8 chess board from any other square on the board, given enough turns.

- This program uses graph and tree search algorithms to get the shortest path between desired start and end squares.
